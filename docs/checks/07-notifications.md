title: Notifications and alerts

Testomato send two types of notifications:

- **Warning** notifications are sent only when crawler timeouts, and
  we are not able to download any content.
- **Error** notifications is sent to you when some [check failed](/checks/introduction).

## When are notifications sent?

Notifications are only sent if the check status changes. If you intentionally create a failing check, 
Testomato will not notify you, because you know about this condition.

A notification is generated, for example, if the previous status was 200 OK and changed to 
404 Page not found. We will then send you a notification. This helps us avoid being overwhelmed by
notifications when setting up new check or change something.
